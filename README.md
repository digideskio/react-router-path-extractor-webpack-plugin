## Introduction

This plugin is designed to work with [StaticSiteGeneratorWebpackPlugin](https://github.com/markdalgleish/static-site-generator-webpack-plugin) and [SitemapPlugin](https://github.com/markdalgleish/static-site-generator-webpack-plugin). It has no standalone functionality other than to precompile a [React Router](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router) routes file and pass the discovered `paths` into a callback function.

The callback function expects a return value consisting of an array of webpack plugins to be applied to your compiler once the paths have been resolved.

## How it works

It adds a [`make`](http://webpack.github.io/docs/plugins.html#make-parallel) plugin to separately compile your routes file using the `loaders` specified in your config.

Once compiled it executes the code in a [`vm`](https://nodejs.org/api/vm.html) and runs [`ReactRouter.createRoutes`](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router/blob/master/docs/API.md#createroutesroutes) on the `module.exports.routes` named export. Finally it executes the callback function, passing the flattened paths into it.

The compiler respects your loaders and is indifferent to how you build your routes. i.e. you can use a combination of [`<Route>`](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router/blob/master/docs/API.md#route) and [`PlainRoute`](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router/blob/master/docs/API.md#plainroute) to describe your routes.

## Signature

```javascript
new ReactRouterPathExtractorWebpackPlugin(
  routesFile: String|{routesFile: String},
  options?: {routesFile?: String},
  callback: (paths: Array<String>) => Array<InstanceOfPlugin>
)
```

## Usage

Have a look at [test suite](test) for a complete example.

#### webpack.config.js
```javascript
var webpack = require('webpack')
var ReactRouterPathExtractorWebpackPlugin = require('react-router-path-extractor-webpack-plugin')
var StaticSiteGeneratorWebpackPlugin = require('static-site-generator-webpack-plugin')
var SitemapWebpackPlugin = require('sitemap-webpack-plugin')

module.exports = webpack({
  entry: {
    main: ['./src/entry.js']
  },
  output: {
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, '_dist'),
    filename: '[name].[hash].js',
    libraryTarget: 'umd',
    publicPath: '/'
  },
  module: {
    loaders: [{
      test: /\.js$/,
      loader: 'babel',
      exclude: /node_modules/,
      query: {
        presets: ['react', 'es2015']
      }
    }]
  },
  plugins: [
    new ReactRouterPathExtractorWebpackPlugin(
      './src/routes.js',
      function (paths) {
        /*
         The callback receives a flat array of paths, e.g.
         [
           '/',
           '/about',
           '/about/contact'
         ]

         Return an array of path dependent webpack plugins in the callback and let
         them do all the hard work:
        */
        return [
          new StaticSiteGeneratorWebpackPlugin('main', paths),
          new SitemapWebpackPlugin('http://example.com', paths)
        ]
      }
    )
  ]
})
```

#### routes.js
```javascript
import React from 'react'
import { Route, IndexRoute } from 'react-router'
import App from './components/App'
import Home from './components/Home'
import About from './components/About'
import Contact from './components/Contact'
import NotFound from './components/NotFound'

// Important: Your routes must be a named export called "routes":
// es5: module.exports.routes = ...
export const routes = (
  <Route path='/' component={App}>
    <IndexRoute component={Home} title='Home' />
    <Route path='about'>
      <IndexRoute component={About} title='About' />
      <Route path='contact' component={Contact} title='Contact' />
    </Route>
    // Exclude paths by adding the staticExclude prop:
    <Route path='exclude_this_path' staticExclude>
      // Child routes will included unless staticExclude is specified.
      <Route path='but_not_this_one' />
    </Route>
    // This catch-all will resolve to /error/index.html
    // staticName will default to '404', i.e. /404/index.html
    <Route path='*' component={NotFound} staticName='error' />
  </Route>
)

// You can always export the routes as default too for use elsewhere.
export default routes
```

## Dynamic Routing

[Dynamic Routing](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router/blob/1.0.x/docs/guides/advanced/DynamicRouting.md) may be possible using a hashHistory Router within a Route component or by adding a catch-all and a bit nginx config. Example coming soon.
